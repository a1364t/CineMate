# AI Cinemate

AI Cinemate is a movie recommendation web application that combines the power of **TMDb API** (The Movie Database) for movie data and **OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo** model for conversational AI. This project is designed to provide users with movie recommendations based on their preferences, and allows them to search for more information about movies using TMDb's extensive database.

## Features

- **Movie Recommendations**: AI-powered movie recommendations based on user preferences using **OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo** model.
- **Movie Search**: Users can search for movies and get more information like genres, release dates, ratings, and more.
- **Responsive UI**: A user-friendly interface built with **Tailwind CSS** and **Flowbite** components for a modern, clean look.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The JavaScript library used for building the front-end of the application.
- **TMDb API**: Fetches movie data like genres, release dates, and ratings.
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo**: Powers the movie recommendation feature using **GPT-3.5 Turbo** model.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the app.
- **Flowbite**: A UI component library for enhancing the design of the app, used in conjunction with Tailwind CSS.

## Installation

To run AI Cinemate locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:

- Node.js installed (Version 14.x or higher)
- A **TMDb API key** (create one at [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api))
- An **OpenAI API key** (create one at [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/signup))

### Steps to Install:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/a1364t/ai-cinemate.git
       cd ai-cinemate
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
       npm install
   ```

3. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your API keys:

   ```bash
       REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
       REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
       npm run dev
   ```

Your application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

Once the application is running:

1. You can interact with the AI Cinemate by typing movie preferences or genre requests.
2. The OpenAI model will respond with movie recommendations, and you can explore more information about the suggested films through the TMDb API.

Example queries:

- "What movie should I watch?"
- "Suggest a comedy movie."
- "Give me a movie recommendation based on action and thrill."

## How it Works

- **TMDb API:** The project queries the TMDb API to get movie data such as titles, release dates, genres, and more. Users can search for movies or get detailed information about any movie by entering their preferences.

- **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo:** The project uses OpenAI's **GPT-3.5 Turbo** model to dynamically generate recommendations based on the user's input. The AI model processes the user's request and provides movie suggestions based on the provided information.
