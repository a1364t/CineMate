          <li>
            <strong>The Movie Database (TMDb) API</strong> provides a vast library of movie data, including information
            on cast, genres, release dates, ratings, trailers, and more. With TMDb, AI Cinemate always stays current
            on new releases and trending movies, ensuring fresh and up-to-date recommendations.

            <strong>OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-turbo)</strong> is the conversational engine behind AI Cinemate. The language
            model allows the site to offer personalised movie recommendations in a conversational style, creating a 
            seamless experience that responds to your movie tastes and questions.
